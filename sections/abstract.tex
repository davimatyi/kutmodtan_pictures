Image-based room layout reconstruction aims to predict the spatial structure of a room from a small number of images. Most previous papers relied on heavy assumptions of the layout, i.e. the room having a cuboid shape, a single ceiling and a single floor. Our work focuses on improving the predictions for rooms that does not satisfy these restrictions. This is achieved with the help of our Segment Knotting Boundary Detection (SKBD). This method detects the connection of segments without heavily relying on their proximity. The experimental results demonstrate that our system vastly outperforms current state-of-art methods on datasets consisting of rooms with unusual layout, but it also performs similarly to them on regular datasets.
