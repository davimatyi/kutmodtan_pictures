\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We have proven the validity and efficiency of SKBD, by evaluating it on two widely used datasets: LSUN dataset\cite{zhang2015large} and Structured3D dataset\cite{zheng2020structured3d}.

\subsection{Results on LSUN dataset}
For this test we trained our SKBD descriptors using the relabeled LSUN dataset released by \cite{ren2017coarse}. The dataset consists of 4000 training images, 394 validation images and 1000 testing images. We manually grouped the images taken of the same room from multiple angles, and resized all images to \( 640 \times 480 \) resolution using bicubic interpolation. We are using a standard metric for evaluation: corner error. It is computed by calculating the Euclidean distance between predicted corners and corresponding true corners.


\subsection{Results on Structured3D dataset}
For this test we trained the models on the Strucured3D dataset\cite{zheng2020structured3d}. This dataset is a photo-realistic, large-scale simulated set, containing 3D structure annotations. It consist of 3500 scenes, a total of 21835 rooms and 196515 images, and has a predefined training, validation and test data subset.
