\section{Conclusion}
The problem presented in this paper was the problem of reconstructing a room into its floor map with as few images taken as possible. We wanted to cover cuboid and non-cuboid shaped rooms, even if it came with taking more than one image as the source of reconstruction. More than one method was tried in order to achieve the outcome, which are detailed in the methodology section \ref{sec:methodology} for the purpose of transparency and clarity of what methods did not work. We presented our solution in a way that allows anyone interested in the topic to reproduce our research. When presenting our results\ref{sec:results} we found that our solution was able to perform at a desirable level.
