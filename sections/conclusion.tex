\section{Conclusion}
The problem presented in this paper was the problem of reconstructing a room into its floor map with as few images taken as possible. We wanted to cover cuboid and non-cuboid shaped rooms, even if it came with taking more than one image as the source of reconstruction. More than one method was tried in order to achieve the outcome, which are detailed in the methodology section \ref{sec:methodology} for the purpose of transparency and clarity of what methods did not work. We presented our solution in a way that allows anyone interested in the topic to reproduce our research. When presenting our results\ref{sec:results} we found that our solution was able to perform at a desirable level. It outperforms known solutions on multiple databases. Our solution also enhances usability by providing output data that is easy to process. Using our method various services and applications can be developed and used. We managed to create a system in which a room's floor plan can be reliably reconstructed and processed for further use. This system not only improves on known methods but also opens up new possibilities for applications that depend on efficient and accurate spatial mapping.
